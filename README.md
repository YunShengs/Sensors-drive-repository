# Sensors-drive-repository
In the development process of embedded projects, we always need to operate various sensors, and rewriting sensor driver code for each project project is a very inefficient task. I have used design patterns, code layering, and modular thinking to write many sensor driver codes, which are classified and stored in this repository.
